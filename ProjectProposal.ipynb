    "Safety is probably one of, if not the most common question that gets asked in regards to choosing an area to live in. Safety from fire hazards, thieves or in our case: cars, can have a profound impact on whether or not people may choose to live in a location. It can be stated that the more likely it is for these events to occur, the less likely it is for someone to choose to live there. So in our analysis, we hope to find and compare different areas with each other in order to see which areas are more prone to accidents and to what kinds of accidents as well. \n",

This is due to the belief that there are more vehicles operating at any given time in a city (such as NYC) than compared to a more urban like setting (like the Town of Cary, NC). Because there are more vehicles, we believe that the chances of an accident go exceptionally higher. Of course, we can also compare data within a single area to see which types of accidents are more common as well.\n",

An example of why cleaning would occur is that there may be misinputted data(such as a spelling error) that needs to be read differently that we may not catch while creating the dictionary. After doing so, we will begin the process of analyzing the data both internally and in comparison to other sets of data.\n",

Although the data may be mostly unbiased since it was recorded by the government, there is a high probability that the data we use is not going to be complete as most data sets are. For example accidents could have occured and not be reported, and therefore would not be present in the dataset, which would potentially skew the results. Another possibility regarding ethics is that we may be putting labels on certain areas such as \"People in so and so are more likely to hit and run then in...\" which can be used to stereotype areas. One method we can use to handle this is to use the general groupings of our analysis instead of more specific names of locations."

    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, our project will contribute to people trying to find new homes with regards to safety in automobile transportation. While our data represents 2 specific locations and their respective data, we can apply our analyses to many diverse populations. We can do this because, as stated before, an area that is more \"city-like\" correlates to greater population and, thus, a more likely chance for car accidents to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our methods dont work or our hypotheses are wrong, we could either test multiple other datasets or fix our proposed methods in order to reduce the amount of skewed data that could potentially invalidate our hypotheses. By testing other datasets and locations, we can possibly eliminate potential confounds that a specific area has. Likewise, we may have to change our approach to certain methods (for example, data analysis) if they do not give the expected results we need for our hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential confound of our data that may cause problems for our interpretations is the ability/inability of the people in a certain region to drive. For example, we can have a region that has very few car crash incidents while having a large population size, potentially skewing our analyses from population density being the main factor that accidents occur to people's lack of driving skills. This is why it is important to choose regions with large diversity to get the most non-biased data we can for accurate results."
